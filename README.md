# Data Notes

This is my notebook on data and programming. I try to keep it updated with examples of common tasks in SQL, Python, and useful libraries.

It's based on the original version of [ChrisAlbon.com](https://chrisalbon.com), the latest version of which is [here on Github](https://github.com/chrisalbon/notes), which I replicated bit-by-bit before I realised that forking a repo would save me lots of time and effort.
